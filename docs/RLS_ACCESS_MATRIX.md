## SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (user-callable)

| Function | Who may call | Guard |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| `assign_parent_to_circle` | Self or staff | Locks + capacity inside function |
| `ensure_circle_daily_prompt` | Active circle member | Membership check |
| `advance_circle_read_state` | Invoker (RLS) | Own membership row |
| `parent_baby_age_months` | Self or staff (0009) | `auth.uid()` check |
| `shares_active_circle_with` | Authenticated | Used in RLS only |

## Service-role only

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `refresh_map_clusters` | Rebuild aggregates |
| `expire_stale_presence_and_refresh_clusters` | Stale cleanup |

## Sprint 6.1 changes (migration `0009`)

1. Replaced `parents_select_authenticated` (global) with `parents_select_scoped`.
2. Added `shares_active_circle_with()` helper.
3. Restricted `parent_baby_age_months()` to self or staff.
4. Added `guard_circle_message_update` trigger — users may only edit message body fields.

## Remaining risks (documented, not fixed this sprint)

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `map_presence.parent_id` visible | Medium | Correlates online users; mitigated by small beta cohort |
| Circle co-members see full `parents` row columns | Medium | App selects `display_name` only; policy still row-wide |
| Realtime channels not RLS-filtered | Medium | Client joins only after assignment |
| k=5 suburb anonymity with ~10 testers | Low–Medium | Low-traffic suburbs may not cluster |

## Manual verification checklist

- [ ] Two accounts in same Circle can read each other's `display_name` via messages join
- [ ] Two accounts in different Circles cannot SELECT unrelated `parents` rows (0009)
- [ ] `parent_baby_age_months(other_uuid)` returns permission denied for non-staff
- [ ] User cannot UPDATE own message `moderation_status` or `circle_id`
- [ ] No `service_role` key in browser bundle (`npm run build` + source grep)
